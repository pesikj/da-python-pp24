10,26-08-2013,"Nous venons de passer une semaine au Majestic avec notre fille de 2 ans et demi, au cours de la deuxième quinzaine d'aout.
Nous connaissions l'hôtel pour y avoir séjourner il y a 3 ans, avant certains travaux d'embellissements des chambres.
Comme la première fois, nous ne gardons que de bons souvenirs de notre séjour; accueil charmant, chambre propre et fonctionnelle, piscine et décorum plus qu'agréable, ....
Les points noirs restent néanmoins les mêmes : la portion de plage dédiée à l'hôtel reste plutôt étriquée, ce n'est pas le coin le plus propre et le plus beau de la croisette et le tarif transat+collation reste exorbitant. Rien ne vous empêches de vous délocaliser sur les plages publiques à quelques dizaines de mètres, l'eau est la même.
Par contre, sur des commentaire précédents, nous avons pu lire que le personnel est désagréable et ne se montre que peut attentif aux doléances de chacun. Je pense surtout que celui-ci fatigue parfois face au manque de politesse et aux exigences incongrues de nombreux pensionnaires. Quand un enfant de 10 ans se comporte comme un nabab du pétrole et ne connait aucune formule de politesse, je veux bien croire que certains craquent.
Les critiques concernant les prix et tarifs n'ont à mon sens pas lieu d'être, vous savez à quoi vous vous exposez quand vous choisissez un 5 étoiles sur la croisette.

Hotellets beachclub var bra, men preget av svært mye støy da det var sliping og høytrykkspyling av piren hele dagen, dette burde vært informert om før man betalte EUR 40 pr seng. 
Dagen etter ble vi anbefalt av resepsjonisten å bruke søsterhotellet sin Beach Club, men da vi kom bort dit var den steng pga vedlikehold... Slik info må man forvente at hotellet har.

8,31-05-2022,"Jeg hadde et helt greit opphold på hotellet, men hvor var luksusen. Jeg forventer meg mere av et hotell med 5 stjerner!!! Selv under Cannes Filmfestival må man også ta vare på “vanlige gjester”. Dette er tydlig et hotel med mange eventer. Ett event settes opp et annet tas ned. Lettere kaos preger en del av hotellets fellesarealer. Eksempel: Når man koser seg med frokosten er det ikke greit med et lass av arbeidere rett utenfor vinduet som demonterer et event. 
Fikk et rom i 7et. som jeg ikke var fornøyd med. ( Hjelper lite med pen innredning når skyvevinduet på veggen er av amerikansk motel standard.
Fikk byttet til et annet rom i 3et. som var noe bedre. Ble ikke “opphisset”.
Ingen blomster, vin eller sjokolade på rommet.
Hotellets gjester har tilgang til stranden/ piret, men ingen rabatt som hotelgjest. Prisene går fra 50-80€ for en solseng m/ badehåndkær. Ikke vannflaske!!! Hotellets gjester burde få en rabatt på dette tilbudet.

10,31-08-2020,"Das Hotel ist wirklich ein tolles Hotel in Cannes, super gelegen und bietet einen tollen Service auch in der Coronazeit. 
Die Zimmer sind geräumig, modern und bieten viel Stauraum. Einzig die Erlebnisdursche in der Badewanne mit der flexiblen Trennwand gibt jedes mal eine Überschwemmung, müsste anders gelöst werden.
Der Zimmerservice hat gut geklappt (Bestellung um Mitternacht) wenn auch erst nach 1 1/2 Std.).
Das Gym ist für so ein grosses Hotel relativ klein, aber dafür mit sehr modernen guten Geräten.
Die zwei einzigen Minuspunkte die wir erlebt haben, war am ersten Wochenende der Frühstückservice. Die Angestellten waren bei dem Ansturm total überfordert und die Gäste (inkl. Wir) mussten 30 min auf einen Tisch warten. Sie mussten sogar dafür die Frühstückszeit bis 10.30 auf 12.30 (!) verschieben obwohl dann der Mittagsservice bereits begann. Dies hätten sie mit Öffnung eines zusätzlichen Saals (vorhanden) umgehen können.
Und der Beach-Club-Service. Als wir am ersten Wochenende an den Privat-Beach des Hotels gehen wollten, hies es alles ausgebucht (ist übrigens der Hauptspruch der Franzosen, egal wo man hinwill), doch wenn wir bar bezahlen würden, hätten Sie evtl. noch eine Liege mit Schirm für uns, dabei waren 50% der Liegen frei, da die Preise absolut überrissen waren (ab 40 Euro/Person/Liege bis zu 120 EUR zu forderst - pro Person versteht sich).

We chose this hotel because there was both a pool and a beach however the pool was not a good experience at all. From around 10.30 it was filled with screaming children with no precautions taken by parents/children during this pandemic. Children by the pool is not something that the hotel could do anything about obviously but good to know for other visitors. Prices in both pool bar, restaurant and beach were exceptionally high (even for Cannes). Paid 21 euros for a few slices of watermelon... Had lunch at Fouquets, the only vegetarian option was bland and tasteless yet at a high price. The beach restaurant had better food but service was poor (upon arriving we were completely ignored, seated then ignored again for 30 minutes before anyone took our order). The beach was okay but there are better options on the croisette (with cleaner water). All in all an okay hotel but there are better options for the prices. Might be a better option for families than for couples/friends/business.",barriere-le-majestic,Cannes,France

Vi skulle få VIP fordeler gjennom hotels, men er usikker på hva dette er.
De ansatte i resepsjonen sa det var tilgang til svømmebassenget, så mulig Bassengområdet ikke er inkludert i prisen. 
Servicen ved bassenget er litt treg til tross for lite å gjøre. Og det er heller ikke mange solsenger, så vær tidlig ute hvis du vil sikre deg en. Hotellets strand har solsenger både på brygge og sand mot gebyr på minimum 50 euro per person, så vær obs på at det ikke er mye inkludert i prisen du betaler for hotellrommet.

1. The hotel is located literally in the middle of the main centre of Cannes, with a short walk to the main Street for shopping and also to the mariner where there are lots of restaurants to choose from. it really is in the best location. 

2. The staff could not have been more attentive and helpful, every person we interacted with did so with a smile and pleasantness:

3. The room was modern, comfortable, well furnished, clean, I literally don't know what else you could need from a hotel room. 

4. We were fortunate enough to get an upgrade with spectacular reviews (thank you very much)

5. The pool area was clean and well maintained. Staff at the bar/pool were always available and happy to help.

Rooms was very small.
They charge extra to use the sun beds (€ 45) which I find ridiculous and never happened me anywhere else.
They charged € 10 for each small bottle of water that you take from the fridge in the room.
The facilities of the hotel (swimming pool etc.) are mediocre.

4,06-08-2018,"Once i checked in it was 8 pm, i got a room which is not what i payed for (lower) i requested to change the room they said no rooms available today maybe tomorrow.. so i waited the next morning to get a room and i got a better room ( size wise) i payed extra 200 euro per night to get this! at 5 pm i got the room because again they were cleaning and preparing the room .. when i got to the room it had a leakage from the ace with a stain in the room dripping .. when i called they said they will send someone to fix , at 11 pm also it continued dripping, when i went to the reception to complain the manager was SO BAD that he didnt want to solve the problem claiming that their is no rooms available and he will send a professional guy to fix the ace and he wants us to stay in the room and deal with it!! I requested my money back to go to any other hotel .. he literally went inside the office didnt want to talk to me .. so i got stuck with the room for the night and at the moring ( 3rd day ) i got a decent room at least .. it was the worst experience!!",barriere-le-majestic,Cannes,France

6,26-07-2018,"We came for our first anniversary, which we mentioned to the hotel; nothing was done to make us feel special, which was unusual for a 5-star hotel. Room was old and decaying - lots of peeling paint and gross build up in the tile and grout. Rain shower and hand held shower had low pressure, I couldn’t even get out my conditioner, and water was spraying out of the handle. 

Got strange bites during my first evening and believe they were caused by bed bugs. I calmly and privately advised the hotel, who said “sorry” but did not seem overly concerned and did nothing to make up for the issue.

Overall, unimpressed. This hotel was not 5-stars and certainly not worth $800/night.",barriere-le-majestic,Cannes,France

I sat at a table waiting to be addressed to take a drink/food order for over 30 minutes and finally left the pool lounge area. Parking, private beach fees were near double other 5 star hotels along the beach. Just did not provide the value I was looking for in a 5 star hotel. After I complained and heard other guest complaining as well, they offered breakfast for two days, however, breakfast had already passed so we took free breakfast for one day and it was a good breakfast but not if we paid the price they were asking, $55/person for breakfast??

When I was booking the hotel after paying lots of money for three nights the add was saying free room with the Sea view in March and April as I didn't get it but was offered to pay extra £100 a nigh for a room with the sea view! 
When went to the terrace bar on quite few occasions the waitress took a long time to serve a drink and that was only I have asked tree to four times to be served! The same thing happened in the restaurant! Was very disappointed! The gentleman was sitting on the table next to me and he couldn't wait any more and after half an hour he just left! Lots of staff around but no service at all! On one of the night we decided to have a drink at the bar after the dinner in town! We walked to the bar and three waiters are talking to each other without acknowledging us! Only after 3-4 minutes as waiting and demanding service we got the drinks but we have it to carry our own drink to the tables which are they by the way dirty and filthy !

I understand this is a 5 star hotel but to charge €44 for breakfast served on a side plate was astounding to me! 
Another disappointing feature is a man who stands outside the hotel and checks bags as you enter.  It felt intrusive  to have my bag checked every time I returned to the hotel (often 5 times a day!) -most unwelcoming to your guests!
Then the occupants of the room next door (which had an adjoining door)started to smoke in the room which filled my room with the smell of cigarettes.  In the morning the smoking started up again!

My chèvre chaud was totally melted and we didn't touch any of the dishes.The manager just stood there and didn't even come to our table even we asked for it. They charged us for full despite this.

Upon checking out it was I who had to ask for compensation ( received 300 Euro off our account) otherwise I wouldn't have received anything.

The front desk were excellent but we found service at their beach area terrible and at a cost of 130euros a day for two sunbeds it was definitely not good value. Noise is a problem in the guest bedrooms facing the pool. They had loud outdoor entertainment until 2am on the Friday and Saturday which meant you could not sleep until it finished.

That is my only criticism. We could have moved the car but we felt a bit embarrassed so we left it there for the night (we didn't want to look cheap).

Our first room (not the most basic) was nice but too small and overlooking the noisy a/c units below. All they could offer to get a quieter room had to be via a paid upgrade which made the stay more expensive than planned. The private beach is a ridiculous price and the pool area is pretty small so no guarantee of a spot to sit.
Generally got the feeling that there were differing levels of service depending on 'who you are' and how much you are paying which sadly attracts some of the more obnoxious members of wealthy society but that said, it generally pretty good. Not the best but good enough with decent facilities and good location.",barriere-le-majestic,Cannes,France

6,19-08-2015,"Top notch hotel. Very high end service. Lovely rooms with impeccable finishings in the updated rooms. One HUGE downside is that even on the 6th floor facing the ocean and pool* it sounded like we were in the middle of a nightclub from 8pm-2am. HORRIBLE! Ear plugs didn't do a thing to help and the windows on the 6th floor were vibrating from the music! The restaurant downstairs turns into one and its patio outside becomes the dance floor in the front courtyard for the ""want to be scene"" smoking crowd... Staff was quite apologetic and got us another room on the side of the hotel with no view and was a lesser room but was quieter. One suggestion to the hotel- limit the nightclub to indoors or shut down the 1000db music after a reasonable hour. If the unforgivable late night noise issue (it is an expensive 5 star hotel after all) was solved we would have given this a higher overall rating.

4,15-07-2015,"We picked this hotel because of its location on the beach and were thinking of combining a bit of beach, pool and shopping. The hotel lobby and room standard are great, but we were dissappointed by the other facilities. Particularly the fact that the hotel charges €32 for half day by the pool plus €32 for half day at the beach (per person). In addition the pool is really small, packed with kids, does not have sun in the evening (5pm-ish) and 0.5l beer in the pool bar is €20. When checking out we found out that the hotel had charged us €45 per day for parking without informing us in advance. When tring to use the roof terrace which is pictured on the web page we were informed that there was no roof terrace. The breakfast in the morning was ok, but not great. Would never have chosen this hotel for either a shopping break or a beach holiday. There are so many good alternatives around!",barriere-le-majestic,Cannes,France

Forgetting our negative experiences: their beach while ""private"" is between 2 public beaches and is much less desirable than others on the croisette and their pool is fine but through the summer they have private events seemingly all the time even by staff accounts so if you want to swim in the midst of a cocktail party....

Overall not the quality you would accept for a Fairmont chain.",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France
4,25-08-2023,"During our recent stay at Fairmont Monte Carlo, our experience was unfortunately far from satisfactory. This review aims to provide an honest account of the issues we encountered, including a concerning incident involving a pipe on the balcony, poor communication, a breach of safety protocols, and an unreasonable charge for pool access.
To our dismay, we discovered a pipe on our balcony that appeared to be releasing what seemed to be feces. We immediately reported this issue to the hotel staff, expecting a prompt resolution. However, it took an alarming two days for the hotel to address the problem. This delay was not only inconvenient but also unsanitary, as it exposed us to potentially hazardous substances during our stay. Furthermore, the hotel staff initially denied that the substance was feces, which further added to our frustration and disappointment.
To inspect the situation on our balcony, the hotel staff entered our room in our absence. Regrettably, they left the balcony door open, which is a significant breach of safety protocols. Not only did this compromise the security of our belongings, but it also raised concerns about our personal safety. The hotel should prioritize the well-being and security of its guests by adhering to proper procedures when entering occupied rooms.
We were taken aback by the hotel's policy of charging $55 per person for pool access. As hotel guests, we expected to be able to enjoy this facility as part of our stay without extra costs.",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France
10,03-08-2023,"Fourth time we have stayed there, this hotel does not disappoint. The staff are wonderful, the room was so comfortable and the hairpin view was stunning. We will definitely be back for the fifth time, hopefully soon.",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France
6,01-08-2023,"FUTURE GUESTS BEWARE: 

1) Hotel is right next to a large scale construction site which is not mentioned anywhere prior to booking. We booked our room facing the Mediterranean Sea and got assigned a room facing the sea as well as the not so nice construction site.

2) We booked this hotel due to the availability of an outdoor pool. However, the pool area is part of the Nikki Beach concept and hotel guests only have access to a few sunbeds cramped behind the bar. Adding to that, the pool is not cleaned and in the morning we found ourselves swimming with bits of old food from the previous night's party. Staff couldn't care less and excused themselves with ""the robot is out of order"" and only when speaking to the hotel duty manager, it was possible to clean it.. 

Too little, too late, and we checked out early. We will find another place to stay next time we're in Monaco.",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France
10,30-07-2023,"This is a gorgeous hotel, situated with views of the marina or famous hairpin turn.  We chose the latter and were truly impressed with the view.  We spent hours on the balcony watching Monte Carlo in motion.  The front desk staff were helpful and the Horizon Rooftop restaurant afforded good food and better views.  We did room service breakfast and that was also fantastic.  The location was also convenient, close to the beach, casino and car museum.  
The pool was refreshing and provided great views from the 7th floor, but was geared more towards local partiers than vacationing families, and I hope the new pool under construction will alleviate the crowding.",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France

Be sure to use bug spray in the evening-mosquitoes.There was no night time entertainment, it’s pretty quiet at night in the hotel. My room was clean every day with fresh towels.

Our original room had stains all over the carpets, stained tub, a worn out chair and was right below a room undergoing construction. It smelled of cigarettes and was disgusting.

6,23-09-2022,Picked this hotel because of the pool. When you log onto the site it’s their opening photo. It looks amazing. What they don’t tell you is hotel guests are pushed to the very back of the pool behind a screen. You can’t even see the pool from there and there is no service. If you want to sit by the pool you need to pay 180 euro. So when we checked in on Monday at 3pm we headed straight to the pool. The entire area around the pool was empty and the area at the back for hotel guests was packed. Made no sense.,Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France

8,16-06-2022,"My mom and I stayed at this hotel as part of our French Riviera road trip in June 2022. The property was lovely, and the staff were attentive, as expected by a Fairmont. However, a few items worth noting: Firstly, two large new buildings are being built in-front of the hotel on the water-side, which means both loud construction noises continuously and also views of the water are partially obstructed by construction. Secondly, the pool at the hotel is part of the Nikki Beach Club. If you want a spot anywhere near the pool you have to pay for beds and bottle fees, if you are a hotel guest you a free lounger crowded together in an area where you cannot see the pool and near the construction so it is all you can hear; this also gets very very busy on the weekends and you may not get into the pool if not booked in advance. When we were there, the hotel was doing a promo shoot by the pool and pulled one of the free loungers by the pool to look like that’s where guests are situated but it’s untrue and deceptive marketing. Lastly, the hotel is also not on the beach as pictured. However, there is a private shuttle to and from the private beach and the concierge and Fairmont beach staff accompany you the entire time during transportation so this was actually a wonderful experience for us. It’s also worth stating that the entrance to the hotel is right on the corner of the  famous hairpin turn so it’s always busy and not easy for in and out driving your own car but the valet help!",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France

10,28-12-2019,"チェックインからチェックアウトまで全てが完璧な、とても快適な滞在でした。

閑散期であったため、チェックイン時に格安でスイートへのアップグレードの提案を頂きアップグレード。３時頃の到着だったのですが、部屋の準備が出来るのにあと１時間弱かかるため少し待って欲しいと言われ、「ラウンジでゆっくりして下さい」ということでドリンクチケット２人分を渡されました。

日本人スタッフがおり、日本語で少し会話。クリスマスなので付近の店はほとんど閉まっているのではないか、レストランなど予約するならお申しつけ下さいとのこと。フランス語も英語も使いこなす初老の非常に紳士的な、カッコいい男性でした。

海の見える素敵なラウンジでウェルカムドリンクを楽しみながら待つこと30分少し。つけあわせのオリーブなどもとても美味しく、快適な時間です。部屋の準備が出来た頃を見計らってチェックイン。

部屋はコネクティングタイプのスイート。ベッドルームが１つ、ダイニングルームが１つです。ここでトラブル発生。コネクティングのはずが間の扉の鍵があいていない。フロントに電話をすると、ものの５分もしないうちにスタッフが空けに来てくれました。海外系のホテルだと電話してからスタッフが来るまで３０分ほども待たされることはザラなのに、非常に対応が素晴らしいと思いました。

部屋は至って快適。他国の５つ☆ホテルにもたまに泊まりますが、遜色ない・それ以上の快適さ。オーシャンビューで海が見えるのが素晴らしいのは当然のこと、夜になると赤・黄・緑・青にペイントされた海側の建物の屋上がライトアップされ、これが夜の真っ暗な海に映える。近くの港に停泊しているクルーザーの明かりがまた何ともお洒落。普通、オーシャンビューって昼の景色は素晴らしいが夜は真っ暗ですよね。夜まで景色が楽しめるのは、さすがだなと思いました。

クリスマスだったこともあり、付近のお店が閉まって居そうなのでルームサービスを選択。やや高めではあるものの、クオリティは最高。コブサラダ、ステーキ、チーズバーガーをオーダー。付け合わせのフランスパンのバゲットもとても美味しい。総額で1.5万円ぐらいだったと思います。

明け方、朝日を見ましたが、空がピンク色に染まる様子はとても幻想的・ロマンチックでした。外に出ても１２月なのに全く寒くない。バスローブのまま、ベランダのテーブルでサービスのシャンパンを楽しみました。

閑散期だったのでリーズナブルに宿泊出来ましたが、繁忙期だと恐らく３倍ぐらいの値段だったんだろうな…と思います。冬のモナコ、おすすめです。ぜひ訪問してみて下さい！",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France

8,19-10-2019,"Friendly hotel, but you need to get used to the pacing.  The check in process took about 25 minutes.  Nothing was wrong, simply it takes the clerk time to type in an incredible amount of information, while amicably talking to you about the features in the hotel.  My booking was through hotels.com, so they had all the information, but seemingly, there was a bunch more stuff they had to input, not just for me, but for everyone it seems.  Not unlike opening a new bank account.

The view of the sea includes alot of new construction in the harbor.  Means there will be a mix of sleek yachts, tug boats, barges and barge mounted cranes.  It's actually pretty interesting.  The days I was there a barge mounted crane was erected, and they were grabbing these huge boulders and building out the sea bed.

The comforter in our room was discovered to have stains from someone breakfast on it, and was promptly replaced.  Laundry was expensive, but prompt and well done.  The concierge team was friendly and knowledgeable.  

We found the best and most interesting food at Cafe de Paris, and easy walk from the hotel.  Take the elevator to the 7th floor, and knock about 10 minutes off of the time it takes to walk there.

The pool is nice, not so pretentious that you feel you don't belong there.  Clean and well attended.

Overall, I'd come back and stay again.",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France

10,05-10-2019,"Overall a fantastic experience for the one night we were in town. The rooftop pool was great and all prices were as to be expected. We had a light dinner at the rooftop restaurant which was equally satisfying.

The highlight was the location (right by the Casinos) and the insanely good water pressure in the shower. I mean, the best water pressure. You should stay here just to experience it--it's religious.

Lobby area is very beautiful , Nice stores , NOBU restaurant , Beds were very comfortable but the hotel does need some paining on the exterior or at least pressure washing and carpets inside the room needs improvement as well as the bath tile cleaning . Cleaners do not clean the black mildew in between the tiles.  This is a pricey hotel as the location is amazing right next to the Monte Carlos Hotel but hotel does need improvements in these areas.  Over all had an awesome stay just thought for the price these items should be addressed.",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France

Lange Warteschlange bei Check in... wir hatten zwei Kinder dabei darunter ein Baby und waren bereit einen Zuschlag fürs früheres Check in zu bezahlen aber das hat das Hotel nicht hinbekommen... nicht mal ein Getränk wurde uns angeboten ... das Zimmer war groß und sehr sauber. Das Bett einfach fantastisch! Babybett war auch gut und sicher. Das zustellbett für unseren großen war nicht so bequem, die Matratze war ziemlich billig und schlecht. 
Am Pool war die Bedienung bzw. Begleitung zu den liegen sehr unhöflich... ich musste warten mit einem Baby auf dem Arm, bis die Dame auf uns kam. Sie hat uns angeblich vergessen wobei wir die ganze Zeit vor ihrer Nase standen und warteten... 
und was mir besonders nicht gefallen hat dass man für so einen teuren zimmerpreis kein Frühstück inklusive haben konnte... Frühstück hat ca 40 EUR pro Person gekostet ... finde sehr übertrieben. 
Es gab noch einen Transfer zum Strand für 35 EUR pro Person inkl Liege. Aber man kann in 10 Minuten zu Fuß zum Strand und ohne liegen ging es auch. Es ist ein Kiesstrand, war sauber und ganz schön. 
Die Lage vom Hotel ist super! Es gibt genug zu sehen in der Nähe.

Location aside, the property oozes luxury; from the moment you walk in you can tell it’s a 5 star stay. Every member of the staff was super friendly and professional and really gave us the celebrity treatment, which definitely made a difference. The pool and restaurants were amazing, and the room was gorgeous. The only negative from the stay is that there is significant construction going on near the water on the east side (some Marina Extension project or something). We had splurged on a sea view room and unfortunately ~70% of the view has construction in it (which was also noisy during the day), so that was a pretty big disappointment especially after paying so much for the view, which would have been absolutely stunning otherwise (although still was nice). The construction can also be seen from the restaurants and pool on the 7th floor. This is nothing the hotel can really control so nothing against it but just a word for the other travelers who get the sea view room - you will see cranes and barges!",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France

The breakfast (not included in our booking) was worth every penny! Properly cooked streaky bacon and a chef-cooked omelette at the roof-top restaurant, what more could you want?! Well whatever that may be, I’m sure they have it! The views are amazing and the location is super for exploring Monaco. Staff are as you’d expect. Their bar, the Nobu restaurant and the Sun Casino are all downstairs so if you don’t need to leave the hotel one night you don’t need to and have an interesting night!",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France

Hotel manger was nice enough to include a complementary breakfast buffet which was nice.  I just didn’t get the experience we had hoped for with an ocean view in Monte Carlo.",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France
2,22-09-2018,"O Hotel é bem localizado. Quartos são bons. Mas para mim pecam forte em pequenos detalhes. Vou citar três situações que vivenciei em apenas uma diária: a) cheguei no hotel as 13 horas e pedi se podia fazer check in. Embora houvesse quarto disponível o atendente falou que somente seria possível após as 15 horas ou eu deveria pagar uma taxa. Ressalto que é uma prática bem comum em hoteis deixar fazer check in antes se o quarto esta disponível. Na mesma viagem parei em outros dois hoteis muito bons (Chateau De La Chevre D Or - Eze e Negresco, Nice) e em ambos os casos foi possível. b) solicitei um quarto silencioso pois estava com  bebe de seis meses com dificuldades para dormir. Acontece que me colocaram em um quarto que fica um andar abaixo do lobby, e havia uma festa naquela noite. O barulho de batidas de salto no teto somente parou as 1 AM. c) fomas para a piscina as 10:30 AM. Quase não haviam hospedes na piscina. Acontece que mesmo assim as únicas poltronas que eu poderia sentar eram bem distantes da piscina e sem sombra (horríveis para quem esta com um bebê). As poltronas envolta da piscina eram pagas. As seguintes ja estavam todas reservadas. Enfim, embora fosse a piscina do hotel os hóspedes só podem a utilizar plenamente pagando taxas, ou solicitando reserva prévia de cadeiras. Completo absurdo. Obviamente não é uma experiência que será repetida.",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France

From the personal welcome by the manager, to the beautiful room, the comfiest beds, and the professionalism and friendliness of all the staff - it was all perfect and I couldn't have asked for more. 

Nikki beach at the rooftop pool was so serene in the morning and the music was a perfect blend throughout the day and evening. 

The management here is serious about customer service and everything has been thought of and works like a well oiled machine.  
The hotel is a 1970s looking building but in an iconic way and it's interior is well maintained and super clean and swanky. It's location is just behind the casino so it's ideally located for strolling around this beautiful part of the world. I would thoroughly recommend anyone to stay at the Fairmont if they are looking for a high end treat.  It's ranking as a 4 star hotel would be better reflected as 5* - it really is a special place.",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France

6,04-09-2018,"We were excited to stay here especially since it’s supposed to be a nice hotel chain. It was also part of our honeymoon and the hotel we splurged the most on. Overall, we were disappointed with the hotel for the price. The rooms or at least our room we found to be pretty outdated. The furnishings look old and the bathroom looks the same. I’ve stayed at many other hotels that are also 4 Star that are much more updated and luxurious feeling. The hotel is big which is probably the best feature - it has a pool, 3 resturants and a nice gym. I did also have two treatments done at the spa and was also disappointed given my expectations for the chain and the price of service. I understand in Monaco/Monte Carlo everything is much more pricey but in this case, you might be able to find a better (smaller/lesser known) hotel for the same price.",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France

So if you thought you’d like a gentle dip and a pleasant book read on your sun lounger, it’s not going to happen. Floor 6 rooms in that area will suffer from the noise too. So unless you like swimming in a club! AVOID!

8,18-08-2018,"Pro: posizione, servizio in camera, colazione, disponibilità del personale 

Contro: camera, servizi extra

nel complesso lo valuterei un buon hotel, ma l’esperienza non vale il prezzo richiesto. Hotel non offre nessun tipo di servizio e/o piccola attenzione nei confronti del cliente se non ad un ulteriore costo aggiuntivo. La colazione e la vista panoramica di camere/ristoranti e piscina è sicuramente il loro punto di forza, tuttavia la Moquette delle stanze risulta essere trascurata e macchiata, sicuramente non un buon biglietto da visita per un 4 stelle. Il parcheggio è a disposizione dei clienti al costo di 60€ al giorno, così come l’acqua in camera rigorosamente a pagamento a cifre piuttosto esose. 

Non mi sentirei di consigliare questo hotel solo ed esclusivamente per il rapporto qualità prezzo decisamente troppo eccessivo per gli standard offerti. Sicuramente la struttura non vale il prezzo richiesto.",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France

One caveat for us though is the pool was our biggest draw when we booked because it’s beautiful and overlooks the sea. It does look like the photo  BUT, it’s like a Las Vegas nightclub from10:00 AM in the morning and all day and night.  So it’s completely inappropriate for young children.  This was very disappointing for our kids.  The hotel did shuttle us each day to the beach, but we had to pay for our beach chairs - which is normal.

6,21-07-2018,"We stayed for just one night at the end of a two week break. Staff were very attentive and friendly throughout our stay. 

The F&B and public areas of the hotel are fantastic! We had a blast in the pool and enjoyed all of the different restaurants and bars. Used the spa for a manicure which was great although I wouldn’t fancy a massage as the music is very loud from the pool party above! It also overlooked a balcony which looks dirty and sad, with one pot plant.

We were offered if we wanted to upgrade our room for a sea view, but we declined and were so pleased as we had a perfect view of the f1 hairpin! 

There were 3 of us in the room, we were offered a cot for my daughter that we refused as we had two beds in the room which was fine, but there was no attempt to make any provisions for the 3rd person in the room, children’s amenities would have been nice but we at least expected a towel! 

The rooms are very dated. They have not been refurbished or upgraded to match the quality of the hotel. Bathroom is marble, which is lovely but then they had old fashioned electrical items such as hairdryer and corroded torch, what looked like an accessible stool, washing line across the bath and a minimal display of amenities. 

The decor, and bedroom again felt very dated, although was fine for our needs if not a bit small. 

Check out was slow, and systems were down, so no bill presentented.

Unfortunately it was the worst, we ended up leaving a day early as we had enough. Don’t waste your money on ocean view rooms, you will see fishing boats and drilling out your window. Nothing magical. The Horizon restaurant which is on the top floor of the building took 20 minutes for a waiter to swing by to take a drink order in the crazy heat in July. The waitress then procedes to breaking a champagne flute near us where the shards of glass hit my husband arm and almost his eye. They didn’t broom the area where the glass shards fell which made me nervous if there were any little children. Nor did the waitress apologize or ask if we were okay. She rudely poured our drinks with major attitude on her face and body language. After we complained, the next waiter told us she was having a bad day.  After this episode, our room was ready so we went there. The hallways look like a outdate cruise ship. The rooms have not been renovated. Even the alarm clock is from the 90’s.  Not what to expect from a 4 or 5 star hotel. We knew we would be paying premium pricing for Monaco but this was them taking extreme advantages of their high end clientele. 60€ for parking a day. Cocktail drinks were in the 20€ -25€ each, a club sandwich would run you 25€, but to pay premium pricing you expect great service and nice accommodations. Unfortunately this hotel felt like a 3 star.",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France

10,22-06-2018,"We visited many places, hotels and enjoyed a couple of sea cruises on our recent European holiday to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary but the stand out location was Monaco and our stay at the Fairmont Hotel.
The hotel and room was very nice and clean and the staff were absolutely brilliant. They were extremely friendly and helpful and giving us a complimentary bottle of champagne and chocolates on arrival for our anniversary was extremely thoughtful. Our dinner experience at the Nobu restaurant was sensational and the meal was absolutely delicious. We would highly recommend the Fairmont Hotel and we would go back there in a heart beat as we were that impressed with their facilities and service.

I could stay there for a week and not get bored. The views was beautiful, right outside the Fairmont hairpin if your an f1 fan. The cleaners did a great job of house keeping, beds were super comfy, you just melt in and fall asleep straight away. Food wise, lunch I would recommend the Horizon for a nice lunch with scenic view. The best part was Sunday Jazz Brunch at Saphir 24 restaurant. Champagne buffet €89 but this includes everything you would want to eat with a great selection of appetisers, seafood, poultry meats to dessert! Just beautiful and enjoyed it with a great live jazz band.",Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France

The check in process was very slow, and the check out process was even worse...about a 30 minute wait. The majority of the staff at the resort were not friendly. Staff at Nikki Beach pool were rude and unattentive; valet staff were snobby and were not friendly or welcoming, and they did not even open the door for us once while they were standing in front of the doors; staff at horizon never came to clear our plates at the breakfast buffet until there was a large pile of dishes in front of us; the bell boy was the only person that was friendly and took time to explain the amenities of the hotel and suggest some nice places to go in the area.

They would not give us the King bed non smoking room, and moved us to a two beds, non smoking room. Claimed that there were no more rooms left in the ""600 room"" hotel.

8,15-07-2017,"We booked the Fairmont for its sea view position, we had been to Monte Carlo before and knew the Hotel.
We think that the decision to have Niki Beach in the roof top pool area is a poor decision and would not encourage us to return to this hotel personally.
However we always review honestly, this hotel has great staff in all areas, the rooms are spacious and clean, with modern bathrooms. Comfy beds.

The location is perfect for visiting Monte Carlo, it's right next door to the Buddha Bar, so I think this area is now being aimed at the younger market.
There seemed to be lots of stag and hen nights around over the weekend we were there.

The reason I marked down for condition and facility is that in certain areas the hotel looks in need of some refurbishment.

8,30-06-2023,"It was a beautiful hotel with a spacious and comfortable room. However, the hotel really missed a trick when they decided to put shutters in front of the balcony doors rather than having standard curtains inside – and the balcony door could not be closed from outside either. We had booked with a balcony due to me being an early riser and my husband not so much but due to the above, I wasn’t able to use it at all while he slept. I found this to be a really, really bad mistake from whoever designed these.

Staff by the pool were always good to come and take your drink order when you first got there, but anything after the first one, we had to seek them out ourselves every time.",Hyatt Regency Palais,Nice,France

6,10-05-2023,"I travel quite a bit for work and spend about 40 days a year in hotels rooms. I have never had such terrible and dismissive service in a hotel or even a hostel (and yes I have stayed in many hotels across France). I may never book another Hyatt.

1. My airline misplaced my luggage and was going to deliver to the hotel later that evening (I arrived to the hotel around 3pm). I was told to follow up with the concierge. The concierge never bothered to call or let me know it had arrived later that evening (I did call down a couple of times to check). I ""found"" it the next day along with luggage for some other poor victims of this hotel. Unacceptable level of service for a hotel of this price/category.
2. Hotels.com noted I was paying extra for a ""sea view"" which was not true. My view was completely 'obstructed'. I was located on the 8th floor and my view was of the noisy pool/terrace and concrete beam. The sea was not visible. 
3. I asked for a late checkout as I needed to take a work call and was refused in almost an abusive manner. The horrible rudeness of the hotel staff was not acceptable, the seemed to enjoy treating me like I was garbage and refusing my request. In the end the rudeness was without reason --- as the lovely cleaning staff told me ""no worries"" I was able to stay the extra hour, take my call, and left at 1pm without issue.",Hyatt Regency Palais,Nice,France

I did as she said, and when I asked the bartender for a Diet Coke, she said she was very busy and I would have to wait for her to make drinks for two tables that had been seated.

Service at pool for drinks VERY slow.  Non-attentive wait staff. Never came around and asked if you wanted a drink or snack. One MUST all but stand up and waive a server down to place an order. Drinks were good but expensive. 
BEWARE of the coffee…7 Euros for a half cup Americano… I ordered three never dreaming of that price…but I ordered them, drank them so felt I shouldn’t complain about the cost…however, it is excessive.

If you can specify a sea facing room as our balcony looked out into a “grass” balcony and other buildings to the back. 
Staff were really friendly and bar was quiet, although we couldn’t go outside by the pool

I didn't eat at the restaurant but there were always patrons and especially on Valentine's Day when they put out extra tables and they were all filled.  Something must have been great.  Lucille was very helpful and kind in the bar.  She took extra time to help me with my French.  The location is so nice with being just across from the Promenade des Anglais.  Oh, the rooms were very nice and very clean.",Hyatt Regency Palais,Nice,France

I set my plate down and went to get juice and when I came back he was removing everything from the table and said these are for the restaurant. There could have been a kinder way to handle it I thought. Other then that I enjoyed the facilities. Small but solid fitness room and indoor pool. I would stay there again and just get my breakfast else where. Oh and be sure you look at the “partial Sea view” before they talk you into upgrading for 50 or 60 euros a night.

8,15-09-2021,The building itself is gorgeous in a FANTASTIC location.  There were TONS of restaurants in a five minute walk…10 minute walk to old town and across the street from the Mediterranean Sea!  For 5 star…the rooms were a rather normal hotel rooms…nothing spectacular but were nice.  The bed was fine and I am a bed snob.  The separate toilet and bathroom was nice.  I also liked the separate shower and tub.  We were perplexed that there were not black out curtains to later to find there were blackout shutters externally on the windows.  They were electric and very easy to use.  The only negative thing to say is about the toiletries provided.  These are small things but the soaps and shampoos were mediocre.  Not a big deal at all.  I am not sure if this is a Nice thing or not but they toilet paper provided was downright painful.  I mean like a torture chamber terrible.  I will know this next time…Cotonelle will be traveling internationally.  If that’s the only negative…we are doing great!  I had a spectacular time!,Hyatt Regency Palais,Nice,France

10,20-07-2020,"Man sollte das Frühstück unbedingt erwähnen. Es wurde viel zu lange an einem personalisierten Service „gearbeitet“..!!
Es macht keinen Sinn ohne Teil-Buffet zu arbeiten. Die Platzierung war viel zu lange. Es ist kaum zu glauben, was passiert, wenn das Hotel voll sein wird
Covid-19 erklärt dies nicht wirklich. Wenn ein kleines Buffet aufgebaut wird, dann kann man noch immer eine Mitarbeiterin zur Hilfe hinstellen. Um ein Spielei zu bekommen dauerte es 25 Minuten. Zwei weitere Pfannen hätten da wirklich geholfen. Die Mitarbeiter waren wirklich sehr sehr nett und hilfsbereit. Nur „too much is too much“. Es hilft nicht, wenn dafür 30-40 Minuten Zeit gebraucht wird. Der Chef im Abzug hätte dies besser koordinieren müssen, statt selber nur abzuräumen. Der Kaffee war kalt, man hatte das Gefühl möglichst schnell gehen zu müssen und als Businessman fühlte man sich in einem Hyatt Regency fehl am Platz.
Es gibt wirklich viel zu tun beim Frühstück, da dies der Tagesstart ist nicht wirklich überzeugend..... Nizza..? Ich erwarte mehr..!!

10,11-12-2019,"It was overall a lovely stay. It was a bit difficult booking a hotel for Nice, France when so many reviews were saying that for each star attached to a hotel to bring it down by one star because the hotels are not up to par. I would have to agree after visiting and seeing other hotels that were on my list to potentially stay at. But this hotel was way more than I expected. The reviews are accurate and I am so glad that they were, this hotels views are gorgeous (I booked a twin double sea view) and it was phenomenal to step outside on my  private balcony and look at the sun rise or set. This hotel is perfect to stay for any season. It has a indoor pool leading to the outdoors, it has a sauna and is along the Promenande des Anglais. Short walk to Old Nice (very short) and the hop on, hod off bus tour is a stop right across from it. If you get the breakfast added to your stay you won't regret it, it's really good and some of the nicest hotel staff are there.

8,19-10-2019,"So we have never been to Nice before, and this was the first city of a multi city trip that had an American hotel chain (Hyatt) offering.  The price was quite a bit lower than the nearby French hotels.

The hotel entrance is a narrow revolving door next to a larger casino, but once inside, it's expansive.  However, once you are in your sea view room, you realize that you are actually set back another 200' and you are actually overlooking a terrace and pool below you.  Your view of the sea is somewhat obstructed by annoying facade that makes up the false front of the building.  

That's all pretty minor though once you are outside.  There's a gorgeous seemingly endless boardwalk along the beach.  Places to sit, shade, and full access down to the water.  It's well lit at night and full of local folks out for a walk.

Many restaurants within an easy walk, as well as high end shops followed by affordable boutiques on Alphonse Karr street.

Food was surprisingly affordable as compared to Monaco, or Zurich.  

While our stay was great, I think I would give one of the French hotels a shot next time, if I could afford one of their sea view rooms.

The concierge Antonio was very helpful and extremely gracious.  A joy to work with.",Hyatt Regency Palais,Nice,France

Huonepalvelun kautta tilattava aamiainen sekä yksityinen ranta palveluineen olivat aivan huippuja!

4,27-08-2019,"We were pretty disappointed with this hotel, given its price and reputation, and we cannot recommend it to anyone.

1. We generally thought that the service was lacking, with the notable exception of the concierge staff. For example, when checking in we informed them that this was our honeymoon and we barely received a congratulations and it ended up being the only place we stayed where we didn't receive a detail because it was our honeymoon. 

Similarly, we once asked for a specific table in the hotel restaurant and were told we couldn't have it because it was reserved, but no one came. The night before check out we asked what time we should leave for the airport and the clerk said ""When you wish"", which was typical of our experience, and then they called a cab for us, but didn't explain how much it would/should be, so we ended up paying 60 euros for a 15 min ride. Service was also generally slow. 

2. The room was generally comfortable, but the hotel's architecture is strange, so very few rooms have a clear view of the beach, and our room was obstructed by the hotel's columns.

3. The amenities in the hotel were also pretty lacking. The connected indoor/outdoor pool and gym facilities are relatively small, the sauna facilities didn't really seem to work and the restaurant was just OK.

Pros:

1. The hotel partner's beach (Sporting) is good (but it requires an extra fee and service was bad).

2. Location.

3. Concierge staff

It may be good for Nice but we can't recommend it",Hyatt Regency Palais,Nice,France

8,07-07-2019,"Hyatt Regency Nice Palais de la Mediterranee is a beautiful property in a stellar location.  Concierge services are outstanding and deserve the highest praise.  The restaurant 3e was delicious and set with a spectacular view.  Our room was small and dark and not as well appointed as Hotel Martinez in Cannes, but satisfactory.

Services only fell short at the front desk.  On check in, we received a trainee who was given no guidance and therefore gave incorrect information and took a prolonged time.  Check out was even more frustrating.  The hotel experienced difficulty processing payment and the front desk staff was both rude and arrogant, blaming the issue on the cards of both myself and my companion.  (Ridiculous as we have two completely separate accounts and both credit companies explained it was a hotel issue, they had not even received a charge let alone declined payment).  This debacle made us late for our flight and though the hotel rectified the issue later in the day independently of anything we needed to do, we received no email indicating that or apologizing for the confusion and delay.  Better training of staff and treatment of guests is necessary at a property of this caliber.",Hyatt Regency Palais,Nice,France

Der vom Hotel angebotene Parkservice für 30€ am Tag funktioniert leider nur etwas schleppend, d.h. man wartet meistens etwas zulange auf seinen Wagen. Das Hotel selbst ist nicht sehr attraktiv. Durch die Erhaltung der alten Fassade ist der Meerblick extrem eingeschränkt und der Blick auf die anderen Hotelzimmer wirkt grau und unfreundlich. Die Balkone sind ungemütlich, grau und  haben eine schmutzig wirkende Umrandung, die Bestuhlung ist sehr einfach. Die Zimmer selbst sind ok, aber nicht besser als 4 Sterne. Das Zimmer war sauber, aber es hat schon ein paar Jahre hinter sich, eine Renovierung wäre angesagt. Das Verdunkelungs-Rollo funktioniert elektrisch, aber zwischen den Lamellen blieb stellenweise Platz, was am Morgen durch gleissende weise Lichtblitze das Schlafvergnügen störte, da der Vorhang nicht zum Zuziehen geht.

4,27-03-2019,"We were slightly disappointed in our stay at the Palais, while the facade is gorgeous, the stay went downhill from there.  Overall, the hotel feels like a watered down American hotel that is posing as a French luxury hotel. The French hotelerie staff is wonderful and very professional, exactly what you would expect, but they do not run the whole hotel. We had several encounters calling the front desk to get someone who spoke neither English or French (we are both bilingual).  Additionally, we asked for the mini bar to be emptied, were told it would be for a 10 euro charge and it never was. Finally, the room was never cleaned very well, glasses were left dirty from one day to the next, and our robes were taken and not returned, which is a problem since hotel rules require that you wear one to go to the pool. The carpets throughout the hotel are stained which is rather upsetting. 

The breakfast was not very good and very overpriced. the Espresso comes from an electronic machine and overall the breakfast feels like something I would get in the states.



While the rooms are comfortable and the view is phenomenal, overall, I would not recommend staying here, either save your money and go someplace that charges for what it actually serves or pay a little more and stay at the Negresco.",Hyatt Regency Palais,Nice,France

6,01-11-2018,I would not say this is a 5 star hotel. I chose it based on the reviews but clearly different people have different tastes. This is a regular hotel and pretty outdated. If you like upscale hotels this is not it.,Hyatt Regency Palais,Nice,France

Estacionamento pago, mas os manobristas são rápidos.",Hyatt Regency Palais,Nice,France
6,29-10-2018,"Just about ok but given it’s a 5 star hotel one should expect much more.

If there is one star that doesn’t shine as brightly, it would be the unsyncopated attention in the dining room. The wait staff makes itself, hmmmm, I shall say “unobtrusive” but that’s not convenient when there’s a tour to catch. But don’t misunderstand: The food is excellent and when tending to one’s table, the staff is finessed. Definitely would stay at the Hyatt again for both  the hotel itself and its location.",Hyatt Regency Palais,Nice,France

We had the facility to leave our bags at the lobby and walk around Nice on the last day despite our check-out being at noon time and our flight being in the evening. Kids did enjoy the pool a lot.
I would not rate the in-house restaurant as high quality as the service was left desiring. We had dinner the last night and the staff/service was all over the place. The restaurant costs do not justify the quality. Apart from that it was great.",Hyatt Regency Palais,Nice,France

Spa tarkoitti huoneeseen tilattavaa hierojaa. Allasalue toiminnallisesti heikohko. Aamiaistilan sisätilat hyvin ankeat, mutta aamiaistarjonta suht ok.

10,26-06-2018,"The location is right on Promenade des Anglais, east of Place Massena and just west of the Old Town. For us, it was perfect! Check-in was very smooth (our timing at the dinner hour may have had something to do with it). Charlotte and company at the Front Desk spoke English and Spanish very well. The room was well-appointed with a balcony that is actually usable. The partial ocean views overlook the open area above the outdoor portion of the pool. If you look at the front facade of the property, you see pillars and below floor 6, you are looking through these pillars at the sea, still lovely, but not totally unobstructed. 
Breakfast was tasty, well above average, but not free on our particular rate. The young man making the omelettes (sorry, forgot your name) was attentive and his creations were perfectly done! It is a good option if you want a more hearty meal than coffee and croissant. 
And the last thing that will have me returning to this property when in Nice again? I left a credit card and commuter card behind in the safe. The front office and guest services staff contacted me the following day after we checked out. They were willing to send the cards to my home, but, in the end, it was easier to have them destroyed. This was handled very professionally with confirmation that a) I wanted the cards destroyed, and b) that they were indeed appropriately disposed of.

2,02-06-2023,"DONT STAY HERE. INSECTS IN THE BED. If I could share ZERO stars, I would. I checked into this hotel on the night of 29 May. I was escorted to a room with a door smaller than the rest of the rooms in the hallway, only wide enough for my one checked luggage to fit through. I requested to be moved to the proper room, which they obliged, but only after claiming this was technically an upgrade (IT WASNT — it is the room I originally paid for. A classic room). Nonetheless, i didnt complain. As I got ready for bed, I moved the pillows and blanket out of place only to find 8-10 small insects buried underneath (see photo of what it looked like). These insects also flew on me throughout the night. I called the reception and told them id like to check out and request a refund and they said I would have to handle this with Expedia, who I booked and prepaid the four nights with. There were also no available hotels at that time for me to go to (it was midnight). I waited until day break and went down to the reception to tell them what happened. They very nonchalantly told me there were flies during this time of year. Upon calling expedia to resolve the matter and get my money back for the nights i didnt stay there, the hotel refused. DONT STAY HERE unless you want bugs in your hair and clothes. I’m still waiting for Expedia to get back to me on resolving the issue.

4,30-09-2022,"I traveled to this property for work and have been to many hotels around the world, it was decent as far as the appeal of the lobby and the vibe it offered.  My issue came to the service staff cleaning the room and the front desk staff as well.  I asked for my room not to be cleaned, I had only arrived the night before.  Upon returning to the hotel after a few hours, my door was standing wide open and my makeup bag was been pilfered through, all my brand-new Lancome makeup was gone.  I immediately reported it to the front desk, they didn't seem overly concerned at all merely discounting the trivial loss as if it was a bother to them. It was the principle and the violation that something out of my room was, in fact, stolen, yet there was a complete disregard.  Upon my return to Geneva, I'll find somewhere else to stay to avoid a repeat.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

10,31-08-2022,"Warwick Geneva is very conveniently
Located close to the Geneva train station. There are a lot of shops and restaurants which is very convenient.  Walking to the station is about 3-4 mins. The condition of the hotel
Is ok, but shows some age. A few things needs to be fixed during our stay. The staff is friendly and prompt.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland
4,18-08-2022,"Aside to location and general conditions of the property, it was a horrific experience.

We had made some purchases and locked them well inside our luggage. One night while we were back at night, we realised our hotel door did not close properly!!! 

As we had some purchases, before we went out on the morning, we always ensure the door was properly locked. So we immediately went in to check to ensure everything was still intact.

We proceeded to make a feedback to the reception as most likely, the house keeping personnel did not lock properly after tidying up the room. I highlighted the importance as well to be more careful in future. Since nothing was lost, I did not pursue further.

But the receptionist first reaction was blaming to the hotel door and myself as she said sometime the door has to be closed harder. She was implying it was my carelessness. They did not perform much service recovery nor apologetic.   I expected more from them after a brief moment of traumatic experience!",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

10,25-07-2022,"Hotel was excellent - great location, clean, comfortable and service very good. Breakfast choices were very good, including cooked options like bacon and scrambled eggs.

8,13-07-2022,"Hotel was great with respect to location to the Cornavin train station. There is a lot of restaurants and shops within walking distance. The hotel concierge gave me a card for free public transportation (you have to ask for it), but the card lets you take any bus, tram, train, etc. for free! The only negative experience with the Warwick Geneva is that the AC is not really good. There's no number indicating the temperature of the room, and it's not clear which way you should actually turn the dial. The room would have been great if I was able to make the room a bit cooler. It's a bit surprising that such a nice hotel has such an antiquated AC unit.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland
2,12-07-2022,"The most terrible hotel in my life. The toilet was not flushed, so used toilet paper was in there. The hair dryer was not working. Some of electricity outlets were not working.

8,02-07-2022,"Good location, close to the main train station and only a short walk to the lake. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Room was very clean, but could have done with updating, as curtains, carpet etc. look a bit old. Main issue was that the aircon was not that strong and it was over 30C on a couple of days that I was there, so got rather warm in the room.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

8,31-05-2022,"Great hotel
In front of the train station and Migros supermarket and surrounded by restaurants - so lots of choice! 
If doing day trips to other cities - handy to have train so close by. 
Train journey is 7min btwn hotel and airport.  
20min walk ro Jet D'eau 
Given free public transport card around Geneva, for duration of your stay when you reach the hotel. 
Bed is soft and comfortable - pillows are a bit too soft for my liking. Good size room. 
Air conditioner - felt too cold or too hot, found it difficult to control over the 4 nights. 
Hotel buffet - lots of choice, good selection of food. Was expensive, but all food is expensive in Geneva! 
Noise level is minimal considering next to a train station - slightly noisy on occasion at night, but NOT loud enough to keep you awake. No noise in the day - the windows do a great job. 
Would definately recommend this hotel.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

Within walking distance of the lake/downtown and the free transportation card they give you can get you to any of the highlights in town. Very friendly and helpful staff, we were first time visitors and they helped point us in the right direction for everything and answered the various questions we had =] The room was also surprisingly large eventhough we didnt book any kind of upgraded room or anything so that was a nice surprise, and the USB plug was definitely helpful!",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

As Americans, we are use to having AC everywhere and it was warm in our room. The hotel staff instructed us to open a window to let cool air in (FYI: Late March timeframe). However, since you are in the heart of city traffic, it was a loud night’s sleep. But we powered through thanks to jet lag. We would stay here again and recommend this hotel to family and friends.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

2. However, I don’t like cleaning service overall. I stayed 5 nights but sometimes they forgot to refill amenities and arrange stuffs(ex. Iron). I asked concierge again but they didn’t. Also, it was annoying that trying to clean the room early in the morning(around 8 Am) without checking whether customer is inside or not. I really don’t understand that this is 4 star hotel’s service. We were 2 people and they gave us 2 bottles of water on the first and second days, but after that days, they gave us only one.

15:00チェックインですが、ホテルに14:30に到着。部屋を準備中だから20分待ってと言われました。準備できたと案内されたのはバスタブなしの部屋。すぐレセプションに戻り、バスタブ付きの部屋をお願いし、変更はしていただけましたが、まるで特別に変えたかのような返答でした。それでもバスタブ付きの部屋にしていただけたことは感謝しています。
バスタブ付きの部屋は、駅前なので広くはありませんが、設備は充実しています。部屋はきれいです。
このバスタブ表示については改善していただきたいです。バスタブ付き浴槽ではなく、バスタブまたはシャワーにするべきです。そうすれば最初からバスタブリクエストをするか、または別のホテルにします。

객실: 침구가 정돈이 잘 되어 있고 깨끗해서 잠을 편히 잤음. 슬리퍼가 있어서 신발 벗고 지내기 편함. 

직원: 직원들은 대체로 친절했음. 그러나 breakfast 결제 과정에서 약간의 문제가 있었음. 객실에 breakfast가 포함되지 않는 방이었고, 그래서 따로 요금을 내고 먹기로 함. 이 과정에서 데스크 직원이 29프랑을 25프랑으로 할인해주겠다고 했음. 그런데 다음 날 아침 식당에서 bill에 가격이 29프랑으로 찍혀서 나왔음. 그래서 식당 직원에게 호텔 데스크 직원이 할인해주겠다 했었다고 말하니, 25프랑으로 수정해줌. 하지만 호텔 체크아웃 때 breakfast 가격이 또 29프랑으로 결제됨. 결제된 영수증을 보고 문제를 얘기했더니 이미 결제된 요금에서 4프랑을 돌려주겠다고 함. 신용카드에서 실제로 4프랑이 환불됐는지는 확실하지 않음. 왜 부서나 직원들끼리 소통이 안돼서 고객을 번거롭게 하는지 이해가 안됨.

Some Staff - rude and unhelpful eg when you need water 1am in the morning, be prepared to be told there is no water as the bar is closed!
Check in - very slow and unfriendly, information not provided about anything.
Check out - quick and efficient, possibly due to the staff member who I believe is the manager",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

10,03-09-2018,"The location is perfect.  Literally right across from Gare Cornavin.  The hotel is walking distance - if you like to walk - from all major attractions - the UN Geneve, Red Cross Museum, Phillipe Patek, St. Pierre Cathedral, Jet d'Eau, Ferris Wheel, English Garden, etc.

Very comfortable - if you can, stay on 7th floor in one of the Penthouse Terrace rooms. They have balconies which are very nice and the views are great.

Only one bad thing to say:  when we checked out, I did not review the bill as well as I should have.  We were charged for an $8 jar of nuts from the room snack bar that we never ate.  I think the previous guest in the room must have eaten them and it went unnoticed when the room was cleaned for us because the peanuts weren't there when we checked in.  They showed up on day two of our stay and we got charged with the missing jar.  Not a deal breaker, but I don't like paying for something I didn't use/eat.  I should have paid closer attention to the bill but we were in a hurry and the line for the charge was in the middle of the other charges and I missed it.  Oh well, $8 for an otherwise perfect stay is okay, I guess.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

6,02-08-2018,"Check in時, 提供了良好的服務 &周邊景點/交通介紹, 房間也很乾淨整潔~
Door man還主動提供雨傘方便雨天出門~
但入住的隔天中午, 櫃台打電話來要求我 ”Pls check out now,  because you only stay 1 night”,
我解釋了我是入住兩晚, 昨天在櫃檯也是支付兩晚的房價(有收據),
飯店給我填的入住資料也是兩晚, 飯店提供的免費交通卡也是三天兩夜~
但對方還是很堅持, 他的電腦資料就是only stay 1 night.
僵持了很久, 櫃檯才發現他弄錯房號了!!!!!! 然後只簡單說了Sorry就掛電話!!
這完全不應該是一家好旅館該有的態度和允許的錯誤. 在心中已經大扣分!
因為有公事要處理. 所以我大概13:00左右人還在房間內, 
聽到有人敲門, 我才起身, 還沒走到門口, 對方就衝進來了!
原來是房務要檢查min bar , 我可以接受日間有房務需要進房間,
但敲門後至少要隔個3秒鐘才能進入房間吧? 
敲門後1秒鐘立刻衝進來, 我還沒來的及披上衣服, 一個男生就衝進房間,

8,31-03-2018,"The superior rooms start from 4th floor. Had such difficulty getting upper floor although paid for it.

Also, had the no disturb sign on the door, yet the housekeeper still tried to come in. Good thing I had the bolt on. Was coming out of shower!!!... The best part, other than the location, was the bar tender. He made the lobby bar a great stop for closing the day and before going up for the night. Pleasant, welcoming, professional, efficient.

8,21-02-2018,"Stayed 16th to 19th February as a long weekend break. Hotel well appointed, friendly and efficient (apart from the Restaurant).  
The only issue we had was with the Teseo Restaurant, booking made for the first night we were there. My wife and I both ordered the same fish dish - only part of one was delivered at first - for some reason they thought we were sharing!  On questioning this the waiter said the rest would be coming soon - 5 - 8 minutes later still nothing and the part dish going cold.  Caught the waiters attention and clarified again two separate dishes and to take away the cold dish.  Surprise, surprise one portion of chips arrived on its own, and about 4 minutes later the two dishes and finally after another few minutes the last element of the  meals arrived.  Totally unacceptable and very annoying.  
The restaurant was run by one busy waiter and with it being full he could not provide the level of service required - it really needed a second waiter.
We did notice others in the restaurant having difficulties getting the waiter's attention and some just got up and left.  We only had the first course and we gave up.
For the rest of our stay including breakfasts we ate out - there are some very good eating establishments providing very tasty, very good value meals with much better service.  
I don't usually write with issues or complaints and to be fare we may have been unfortunate with our experience, however it did taint our, up until then, good experience.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland
10,19-02-2018,We needed to book an overnight stay in Geneva which was close to the train station to enable easy travel by train to Sion next morning. The Warwick is a 2 minute walk across the street from the main station entrance and even at 11pm this felt a safe walk. The check-in was speedy and we were delighted to have a penthouse family-sized room with an amazing view from the balcony. After a very comfortable sleep we awoke to a panoramic view of the city which included snow. The breakfast was amazing - a huge choice at the buffet complimented with delicious hot drinks including hot chocolates. I absolutely recommend.,Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

The hotel is across the road from the station and so convenient. The staff were pleasant on both occasions. ~On the second stay the price was significantly higher than the first. Also they had sprayed some chemical down the corridor to our room and in the room itself. It was toxic and got on our chests so that we had to sleep with the window open.

The room was spotless and the view from the balcony was breathtaking. My partner said he had the most incredible nights sleep and I couldn't agree more - the mattress was comfy, the pillows were amazingly fluffy, and the room was lovely and warm.

10,13-04-2017,"Value for money, excellent staff who have even contacted me to arrange to send me something I left in the room and really good cleanliness. No real downsides, some of the common areas are a bit tiered and you have to get a tube to the central area which is as cheap as chips at less than 2 euros a trip. In a nice area with lots of restaurants and the French restaurant they recommended was fantastic. I will go again.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

I had a nice view of the plaza in front of the train station from my window, but unfortunately, that meant that people on the plaza had a nice view of me. It was a tad far from the touristic center of Geneva but convenient if you were taking the train (like me). I didn't eat breakfast at the hotel, finding it too expensive (like most things in Switzerland!) and instead went to this lovely place called ""The Cottage"" about a seven minute walk downhill.

4,23-02-2017,"I stayed at the Warwick for a week in February 2017. The hotel room is clean and comfortable (the bed and pillows are great !). The hotel is located conveniently across the Cornavin stattion, so transport to all sites and places is super easy (this also makes the front facing rooms a bit noisy !). 

Overall the stay was below average as the staff interactions were not always pleasant and in some cases I was made to feel as if my presence was a bit of a hassle for them. The check-in was brusque and I was informed of ""problems"" on my reservation that were never followed up. For both my reservations, they did not offer a queen bed in spite of the hotel not fully booked and I had to pay extra to the next category to get a larger bed. While the rooms are comfortable, the bath area did have some black mould on the bathtub area.  They are also renovating some of the rooms and this can add a bit of noise if you are staying  the room during weekdays.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

Remember to collect the free train ticket from the airport ticket machine while waiting for your luggage to arrive. The service at the hotel was excellent. Our room on the 7th floor was much better than we expected. Great view over the city with the mountains on the background (not the Alps, though). Big balcony, more like a terrace. Had breakfast at the hotel every morning, food was fresh and good, nothing special but the atmosphere at the breakfast room was nice and the service was great. The proximity of the railway station and the bus station made it very easy to travel to Montreux and France (day trips to Chamonix and Annecy)... or just about anywhere.

6,31-08-2016,"The hotel was located adjacent to the main train station and a ten minute walk from Lake Geneva. While not the most scenic area of Geneva, it was central to almost anywhere and easy to get around on foot. The staff was extremely friendly and went out of their way to help us during check-in. The room was clean, and would have been fine had it not been for the air conditioning. The air conditioning did not work, or it worked only a little, because we could hear it come out but did not feel a change in temperature. It was very hot in Geneva while we were there, and the room felt unbearably hot even after keeping the curtains closed all day long. This made sleeping extremely uncomfortable, and my friend and I could barely stay asleep at night because of the heat. This hotel would be fine to visit during the winter or cooler months, but needs to fix their a/c situation during the winter, as I would not be able to stay in that room again in warmer weather.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

Caso tenha um vôo pela manhã os trem começam a rodar a partir de 04:40 da manhã, sendo que o tempo até o aeroporto é de 10 minutos, o que elimina a necessidade de se hospedar em um hotel perto do aeroporto. Além disso, fica próximo das principais atrações da cidade. O quarto é de um tamanho bom, mas no nosso quarto haviam colocado uma cama de solteiro (ou ela ficou do hóspede anterior), o que diminuiu muito o espaço para as malas. O banheiro possui um bom tamanho. O quarto e o banheiro estavam limpos. A recepção nos deu uma mapa da cidade e nos orientou sobre como chegar as principais atrações da cidade, o que embora não fosse necessário (eu já sabia o trajeto) foi um toque agradável, já que não tive essa atenção em nenhum outro hotel. Todos da recepção com quem tratei foram atenciosos e não tive nenhum problema com o hotel.

8,04-08-2015,"Hotellet ligger mitt emot Järnvägsstationen. Det går att stanna några minut utanför hotellet, sedan får man anvisning om hur man hittar garaget som har hiss till receptionen. Det är billigare att betala för garaget i parkerings automaten. Rummet var litet. Det finns en mängd bra restauranter i närheten. Frukosten är dyr men verkligen av dom bättre.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland
10,30-07-2015,"I felt very welcome by all the Hotel staff; starting with the reception. guest relations manager, and the ground staff. 
The lounge bar and restaurant was an added plus to welcome friends. It felt like being at home. The location was ideal because it is just across from the railway station, where the train from the airport arrives. It was also convenient being not too far from the UN Agencies and of walking distance to the town centre and the lake.
A very warm thank you to all for  a very pleasant stay. I hope to be back again soon.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

8,28-06-2015,"Arrived early so room was not ready, but was early am, so not surprising. Room was in front of Hotel, but double glazed, so no problem with noise from road. Dining room was excellent and the Maitre'd was also excellent and most helpful at all times. Front of house staff, helpful and obliging. Excellent position as over road from central Railway Station, so can get into Geneva quickly from the Airport so without problems with other types of transport.

8,02-06-2015,"Hotel is very nice. Room 214 is clean, and service is good. Only negative is a design flaw of the hotel,windows. Room 214 catches the afternoon sun which heats the aluminum window frames to a point where they are extremely warm, almost hot to the touch. It is like have a radiator running full blast in the summer. The room air conditioning is inadequate to handle this heat problem. The room is extremely uncomfortable until early morning. Suggest not book a room in the front side of the hotel until winter",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland
8,02-06-2015,"Palvelu oli hyvää varsinkin hotelliin tullessa, mutta lähtöpäivänä palvelu ei enää kiinnostanut. Hotellihuoneen siivous meinasi jäädä tekemättä molempina päivinä. Oliko henkilökuntaa liian vähän? Työaika loppui ennenkuin meidän huone oli siivottu vaikka olimme olleet koko päivän poissa!!! Hotellilla oli hyvä ja keskeinen sijainti.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland
10,24-05-2015,"Hervorragendes , zentral gelegenes Hotel in Genf. Guter Service, saubere Zimmer, gute Betten, und gute Schallisolation der Fenster.
In 3 min zu Fuss ist man beim Cafe de Paris.
Parkplatz kostet extra, im Le Signe Parkhaus aber sehr nahe.

Einziger Minuspunkt: Frühstücksbuffet ist für den Preis eher enntäuschend.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

8,09-05-2015,We liked the hotel. It is only a two minute walk from the railway station. The staff is hospitable and very friendly. Despite a long queue at the reception on arrival it took only a couple of minutes to get the keys to our room. What we liked most is that we managed to check in earlier and that we could borrow an umbrella every time we went sighseeing. All in all  we are pleased that we chose it for our stay.,Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland

10,06-05-2015,"Location is excellent. Almost across the street from the railway station and tram and bus stops. Lots of restaurants nearby. You get a free public transportation ticket for your stay which is convenient. We rented a car for a couple of days, and there is a garage just around the corner. You validate your ticket at the reception. There is also a choice of continental and buffet breakfasts.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland
8,04-05-2015,"Our check-in was fast and the staff very pleasant as well as efficient. Unfortunately, the room was not ready and we waited quite a long time in the lobby.  They explained that  they had had a large checkout.  The room was on the 1st floor and had a street view which was interesting in the day time.  However, at night, one could hear all the cars and the party goers up until 2-3 am.  I am sure a higher room would be much better.  The carpet seemed new and all the furnishings were very modern.  The  bathroom was well supplied.  There was lots of   underground shopping was right under  the building as well as across the side  street.  The street cars ran right by the door and the big Geneva train station entrance  was about 1/2 a block away-- so easy for the airport transfers.  Tour company ticket booths, Lac Leman  and the fountain were a few blocks away. The big shopping area an easy walk as well.  The Front Desk gave us a voucher for free local travel on the public transportation.  This could used to go to the airport on departure day. I would recommend this hotel.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland
